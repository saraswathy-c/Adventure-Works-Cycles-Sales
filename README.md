# Adventure-Works-Cycles-Sales
Problem Statement: You play the role of Business Intelligence Analyst for AdventureWorks Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company. Your role is to transform raw data into professional-quality reports and dashboards to track KPIs, compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers.
This project was done alongside the Udemy course with Maven Analytics.

The project follows the key stages of the BI workflow, and simulate real-world tasks that data professionals face on the job:
#1: Connecting & Shaping Data - building automated workflows to extract, transform, and load the project data using Power Query, use profiling tools, and table transformations.
#2: Creating a Relational Data Model - cardinality, normalization, filter flow and star schemas, and build the project data model from the ground up.
#3: Adding Calculated Fields with DAX- DAX and create calculated columns and measures. Also explored row and filter context, filter functions, iterators, and time intelligence patterns.
#4: Visualizing Data with Reports - this stage brings data to Life with reports and dashboards. Built and formatted basic charts, and added interactivity with bookmarks, slicer panels, parameters, tooltips, report navigation, etc.
Moreover the project used powerful AI tools like decomposition trees, smart narratives, and natural language Q&A.

So, the objective here is to use Power BI desktop to connect and transform the raw data, build a relational data model, create calculated columns and measures with DAX, and finally, design an interactive dashboard to help visualize and analyze that data.
